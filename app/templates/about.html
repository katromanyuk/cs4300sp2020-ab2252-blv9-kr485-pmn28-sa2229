            <p>
                Melodic Monkey Movies is an application that generates personalized movie recommendations to its users based 
                on a variety of possible input options. 
                An input of a movie is required, and is used to search for movies with 
                similar plots. This application also tries to further gauge the "mood" of the user by offering the options to enter a
                song, a music artist, and/or a quote. Additionally, the user has the option to select which streaming services they 
                have access to in order to further personalize the suggestions they receive. <br><br>
                The output includes some summary statistics of the overall sentiment, in terms of positivity and negativity, that 
                was gathered from the user's input(s). 
                The final suggested list of movies also includes a score that represents how similar each movie is to the unique input of the user.
                <br><br>
                When just a movie is entered, the main component of the score is generated by computing a similarity score between 
                the plot of the inputted movie and the plots of over 26,000 movies in the application database. 
                However, the score also incorporates the similarity between the sentiments of the plots, as well as the average user ratings 
                (according to IMDB) of the suggested movies. <br><br>
                In addition to a movie, if the user also enters a specific song, a musical artist, and/or a quote, the algorithm assumes that these 
                additional inputs are more indicative of the user's mood, and uses these to compute a sentiment score, rather than the plot 
                of the movie. 
                For a song input, sentiment is computed using the lyrics of the song. For just an artist input, sentiment is computed using the 
                lyrics from the artist's 3 most listened to songs. For a quote, the sentiment is computed using the text of the quote. 
                If both a music and quote input is provided, the sompute sentiment is the average of the two.
                The overall score is then computed via a weighted average of the similarities between the plot of the inputted movie and 
                the plots of the movies in the application database, and the similarity between the computed sentiment score (as described 
                above) and the sentiments of the movie plots in the application database. As before, movie ratings are incroporated into 
                the scores in order to give an additional boost to highly ranked movies.
                <br><br>
                If the user chooses to select the streaming services they have, a boost is given to the scores of the outputted movies 
                if they are available on any of the selected platforms. However, movies that are not available on the user's selected 
                platforms are not filtered out, and therefore may still be suggested if they otherwise have very high similarity scores 
                to the user's input(s).

                The information regarding the user's inputed movie and music selections is gathered using the OMDB API and GeniusLyrics API. 
                The movie database used for recommendations is the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, extracted from Wikipedia and Freebase.
