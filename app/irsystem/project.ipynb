      "{'Crime': 'Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. The aging patriarch of an organized crime dynasty transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York is portrayed while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on the family crime syndicate. When the menace known as the Joker emerges from his mysterious past, he wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, the Dark Knight must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice. A jury holdout attempts to prevent a miscarriage of justice by forcing his colleagues to reconsider the evidence. The lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster\\'s wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption. The story of Henry Hill and his life through the teen years into the years of mafia, covering his relationship with wife Karen Hill and his Mob partners Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVitto in the Italian-American crime syndicate. Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his motives. A young F.B.I. cadet must confide in an incarcerated and manipulative killer to receive his help on catching another serial killer who skins his victims. A sole survivor tells of the twisty events leading up to a horrific gun battle on a boat, which began when five criminals met at a seemingly random police lineup. Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl, is reluctantly taken in by Léon, a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. Léon and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin\\'s trade. A former neo-nazi skinhead tries to prevent his younger brother from going down the same wrong path that he did. The lives of guards on Death Row are affected by one of their charges: a black man accused of child murder and rape, yet who has a mysterious gift. An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston.
